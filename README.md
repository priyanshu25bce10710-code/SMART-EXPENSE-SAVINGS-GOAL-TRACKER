**OVERVIEW**
This project is a basic Expense Tracker built using Python. It lets users add their daily expenses, view everything they have recorded, and even search expenses by category. All the data is saved in a simple JSON file, so the information stays safe even after closing the program. The goal of this project was to create something practical and easy to use while learning how file handling and menu-based programs work in Python.

**FEATURES**
1.Easy Expense Entry: Users can quickly add daily expenses with details like amount, category, and description.
2.View All Records: The program neatly displays all saved expenses so users can track their spending anytime.
3.Category-Based Search: Users can filter expenses by category to see where most of their money is going.
4.Saving Goals: The app allows users to set saving goals and track their progress toward them.
5.Data Stored Safely: All records are saved in a JSON file, so the data stays intact even after closing the program.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED**
1.Language: Python 3.x
2.Storage: JSON File Handling
3.Modules Used: json, datetime

**INSTRUCTIONS USED**
1.Add a New Expense:
Select Option 1, enter the amount, category, and description, and confirm it is saved.
2.View All Expenses:
Select Option 2 to verify that the newly added expense appears in the list
3.Search by Category:
Select Option 3, enter a category (e.g., Food, Travel), and check if the filtered results display correctly.
4.Set a Saving Goal:
Select Option 4, enter your saving target, and confirm it is stored successfully.
5.Check Data Storage:
After adding some expenses, open the data.json file to verify that all entries and goals are saved properly.
6.Exit and Reopen the Program:
Close the app, open it again, and verify that previously saved data still appears (tests file persistence).
